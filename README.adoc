SNES tile compression 1
=======================

This is an attempt to get better tile data compression, without
going all the way into entropy coding slowness.

It beats LZ4 by 8-15%, and since it currently compresses one tile at
a time, SNESTC1 data can be re-compressed to make it even smaller.
It should still decompress faster than gzip even when combined with
LZ4/LZO.

It also beats one solution commonly used in the SNES commercial era,
RNC ProPack, but then so do many others.

Comparison on one game's BG graphics, 1943680 bytes total:
