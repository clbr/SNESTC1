SNES tile compression 1
=======================

This was an attempt to get better tile data compression, without
going all the way into entropy coding slowness. At the time it
doesn't compress well enough to continue with and do the SNES-side
decompressors.

It beats LZ4 by 5-15%, and since it currently compresses one tile at
a time, SNESTC1 data can be re-compressed to make it even smaller.
It should still decompress faster than gzip even when combined with
LZ4, but I was hoping for smaller sizes.

It does beat one solution commonly used in the SNES commercial era,
RNC ProPack, but then so do many others.

Comparison on one game's BG graphics, 1943680 bytes total:
